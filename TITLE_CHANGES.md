# Feedback WPC-20-IT - Title changes

Proposed position title proposed for my role, `[Senior] Developer`, does not adequately describe the nature of activities, skills, account abilities and responsibilities of some members of my team, within STARS Faculty Solutions. Suitable job titles include `[Senior] Automation Engineer`, `[Senior] Site Reliability Engineer` or `[Senior] DevOps Engineer`.

Position titles should be accurate and descriptive, reflecting role, accountability and responsibility, as they are the link between the individual and the role. In my case, the proposed title of `Developer`, does not describe my role or responsibility is a way which would inform those I communicate with of my job function.
 
Section 14H of WPC-20-IT.pdf (16 Sept 2020) asserts a desire to create consistency throughout IT by use of similar of job titles, and it refers to the insight and Pulse surveys of earlier this year. The change in titles is not in fully aligned with the information it references (quoted below), and conversations with management have informed us the change is for the purpose of reducing administrative effort.

This is the text of the email of 16/April/2020 sent to all IT staff:

> Clarity on role title and responsibilities - This year we will be completing an exercise to review all PD's and job titles within UNSW IT. We have already started the review of job titles and from next month will start working on updating PD's for consistency across IT. This will be a big piece of work as we have over 400 employees in IT so watch this space.

1. An incorrect job title causes confusion and misrepresents its holder
1. A position title can be a source of pride for its holder and demonstrates the employers respect for its holder
1. Conversly, an incorrect title is disrespectful because it mis-represents the activities, skills, accountabilities and responsibilities of its holder
1. Use of an incorrect job title hinders recruitment
1. The WPC change document itself is not consistent in its application of the principle it proposes. e.g., the proposed structure for Customer Service Delivery, Production Services, many job titles are specific (page 40 WPC-20-Impact-DFO-IT.pdf).
1. The title 'Developer' has an accepted meaning within IT industry, which accurately covers some roles, noting there is often a further qualification for it to be meaningful,  e.g. a  Application Developer, Web Developer, Kernel Developer, however there is no qualification which could be added to the 'Developer' title to correctly represent the work carried out by many of the STARS Faculty Solutions Team.
1. The justification of reducing administrative effort should be stated
