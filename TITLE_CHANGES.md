# Feedback WPC-20-IT - Title changes

Proposed position title proposed for my role, `[Senior] Developer`, does not adequately describe the nature of activities, skills, account abilities and responsibilities of some members of my team, within STARS Faculty Solutions. Suitable job titles include `[Senior] Automation Engineer`, `[Senior] Site Reliability Engineer` or `[Senior] DevOps Engineer`.

1. Titles should be accurate, informative and descriptive. In my case, the proposed title of `Developer`, is being used in a way which is not consistent with the broader tech sector.
1. An incorrect job title causes confusion and misrepresents its holder. It may also hinder recruitment. 
1. Section 14H of WPC-20-IT.pdf (16 Sept 2020) asserts a desire to create consistency throughout UNSW IT, however conversations with management have informed us the change is for the purpose of reducing administrative effort. This should have been stated.
1. The WPC change document is not consistent in its application of the principle it proposes. e.g., the proposed structure for Customer Service Delivery, Production Services, many job titles are specific (page 40 WPC-20-Impact-DFO-IT.pdf).
