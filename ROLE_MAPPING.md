# UNSW IT Workplace Change feedback - Richard Green - Mapping

The document proposes a new position title for my role, `Developer` and states my responsibilites are unchanged.

Upon my queries, HR has clarified that the new position description (PD) associated with the title will be effective (email, Christina Batsilas, 1/10/2020, subject 'Developer PD - Level 7'), and they have provided the PD (email, Christina Batsilas, 1/10/2020, subject 'Missing PD for 'Developer' in STARs / Faculty Solutions').

My unchanged accountabilites and responsibilies are aligned with the PD of the `Senior Developer` role, not the `Developer` role, so that should be the Title and associated PD which are set by the proposed structure for STARS Faculty Solutions.

Following is a summary of evidence which demostrates my current role is aligned with the `Senior Developer` role:

- Meeting with Christina Batsilas, Victoria McGloin, discussing support for position reclassification to reflect current rolep, 9am 28 February 2020
- HR24 form signed by my management 28 February 2020
- Meeting with Christina Batsilas, James Rogers, 'PD Discussion', Thursday 19 March 2020, where my role was acknowleged.

Additionally I can demonstrate I perform the role desribed by the `Senior Developer` position. The table below shows the accountablities and responsibilities for both `Developer` and `Senior Developer`, with the differences between the levels __emphasised in bold__.
