# UNSW IT Workplace Change feedback - Richard Green - Position Description

The document proposes a new position for my role and states my responsibilites are unchanged. My current responsibilites, since prior to 2017 Workplace change where Faculty IT staff were moved to UNSW IT, are aligned with the role __Senior Developer__, not __Developer__.

__I propose the WPC document be ammended to show the role against my name is for Senior Developer__.

I have been informed by HR the WPC proposal is formed from existing position description, which has not bee revised since 2013, and reference to the EA (ref. email from Christina Batsila). The PD is not reflective of my current roles and responsibilies, which have significantly evolved.

This is supported by my request for reclassification of my role and an update to my position description of Q1 2020, which was handled by Christia Batsila. My management at that time offered support for reclassification, however the process was stopped immediately prior to the reclassification board meeting of week 3 March 2020.
