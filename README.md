# UNSW IT Workplace Change feedback - Richard Green - Mapping

The document proposes a new position for my role and states my responsibilites are unchanged. My current responsibilites, since prior to 2017 Workplace change where Faculty IT staff were moved to UNSW IT, are aligned with the role __Senior Developer__, so I propose this is a mapping opportunity for my current role to be mapped to the new position description.

I have been informed by HR the WPC proposal is formed from existing position description, which has not bee revised since 2013, and reference to the EA (ref. email from Christina Batsila, IT HR partner). The PD is not reflective of my current roles and responsibilies, which have significantly evolved.

This is supported by my request for reclassification of my role and an update to my position description of Q1 2020, which was handled by Christia Batsila. My management at that time offered support for reclassification, however the process was stopped immediately prior to the reclassification board meeting of week 3 March 2020. I have attached HR-24 form which was prepared and signed by my manger, which presents a business case for the reclassification.

I have addressed how my current role already has accountabilities, and responsibilies meet each the accountabilities, skills and experience, of the Lead Developer role, below.
