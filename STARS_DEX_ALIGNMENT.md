# STARS DEx Alignment

Organisational structure suggestion to move Corporate Services Digital to STARS. 

The there is significant overlap of technology used by both groups, and some duplication of coverage, and we face similar issues with regards to maintaining currency of hosting platforms 

In some regards, the technologies supported by STARS are a super-set of those of DEx.

STARS have a dedicated tester team, there would be advantages of skills alignments and the shared need for similar technology solutions in the area if web site hosting:

- STARS - Faculty Solutions
- STARS - Testing

Similarly, the Corporate digital team have branding and marketing technical delivery skills which are required to be applied to many STARs services.

In the short to medium term, by focusing effort and avoiding duplication we can improve delivery, lower our operational costs and reduce risk. The larger pool of resources allows for greater flexibility, and better skills coverage, in assembling project team, reducing some of the risks we currently assume due to there being both a lack of knowledge, and a lack of capacity to take step to address the problem (running to stand still vs getting ahead).
