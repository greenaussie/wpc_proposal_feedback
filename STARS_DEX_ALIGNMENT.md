# StARS and Corporate Services Digital teams alignment
 
Organisational structure suggestion to move `Corporate Services Digital`  team to `StARS`. 
 
The there is significant overlap of technology used by both groups, and some duplication of coverage, and we face similar issues with regards to maintaining currency of hosting platforms. In some regards, the technologies supported by `StARS` are a super-set of those of `Corporate Services Digital`, and in the longer term, there will be need for adoption by `StARS` for newer major technology platforms such as Adobe Experience.
 
It is already proposed the `StARS` testing team will be used by `Corporate Services Digital`, so this allows for those resources to be better aligned under the same management structure.

The Corporate Digital team have branding and marketing technical delivery skills which are required to be applied to many `StARS` services.
 
In the short to medium term, by focusing effort and avoiding duplication we can improve delivery, lower our operational costs.

With a larger pool of resources, there will be greater flexibility,  and better skills coverage, resulting in reduction of risks we currently assume due to there being both a lack of knowledge, capacity. We can be _getting ahead_ instead of _running to stand still_.
